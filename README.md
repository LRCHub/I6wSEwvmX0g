```
The king of the century
The king of the century
The king of the century
The king of the century

Me
In the middle of the street
I can find a hell in paradise
I don't wanna feel myself alone-one-one-one

You
In the middle of the night
I can see your face, I see the eyes
I will catch you just before you're gone-one-one-one

Now, you can beat the future
You can see what this is all about
And you never feel the same again

'Cause you're the king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are

The king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are, tonight

You
In the middle of nowhere
Can you tell me anyone's in there?
Would you make me love all night 'till dawn-awn-awn-awn?

Now, you can beat the future
You can see what this is all about
And you never feel the same again

'Cause you're the king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are

The king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are, tonight

The king of the century
The king of the century

Now, you can beat the future
You can see what this is all about
And you never feel the same again

'Cause you're the king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are

The king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are, tonight

Now, you can beat the future
And you never feel the same again

'Cause you're the king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are

The king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are, tonight
