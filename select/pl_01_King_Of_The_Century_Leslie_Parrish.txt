The King Of The Century
The King Of The Century
The King Of The Century
The King Of The Century
Me
In the middle of the street
I can find the hell in paradise
I don't wanna feel myself
alone, on, on, on
You
In the middle of the night
I can see your face,
I see the eyes
I will catch you just before
You're gone, on, on, on
Now you can beat the future
You can see what this is
all about
And you never feel the
same again
'Cause you're the
King Of The Century
Never give up on love
The King Of The Century
Never give up on what you are
The King Of The Century
Never give up on love
The King Of The Century
Never give up on
what you are tonight
You
In the middle of nowhere
Can you tell me anyone's
in there?
Would you make me love from
night, 'till dawn on, on, on?
Now you can beat the future
You can see what this is
all about
And you never feel the
same again
'Cause you're the
King Of The Century
Never give up on love
The King Of The Century
Never give up on what you are
The King Of The Century
Never give up on love
The King Of The Century
Never give up on
what you are tonight
The King Of The Century
The King Of The Century
Now you can beat the future
You can see what this is
all about
And you never feel the
same again
'Cause you're the
King Of The Century
Never give up on love
The King Of The Century
Never give up on what you are
The King Of The Century
Never give up on love
The King Of The Century
Never give up on
what you are tonight
Now you can beat the future
And you never feel the
same again
'Cause you're the
King Of The Century
Never give up on love
The King Of The Century
Never give up on what you are
The King Of The Century
Never give up on love
The King Of The Century
Never give up on
what you are tonight
